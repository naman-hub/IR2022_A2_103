## Microsoft learning to rank dataset



```bash
  1. Consider only the queries with qid:4 and the relevance judgement labels as relevance score.

  2. Make a file rearranging the query-url pairs in order of max DCG. State how many such
files could be made.

  3. (5 points) Compute nDCG
    (a) At 50
    (b) For the whole dataset
    
  4. Assume a model that simply ranks URLs on the basis of the value of feature 75 (sum of
TF-IDF on the whole document) i.e. the higher the value, the more relevant the URL. Assume any
non zero relevance judgment value to be relevant. Plot a Precision-Recall curve for query “qid:4”.
